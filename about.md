# Howdy. <i class="icon-smile"> </i>


I\'m an Atlanta-based web developer, currently working for 
[Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com). I\'m a Ruby 
on Rails newbie (and a recent ex-Java dev). I\'m also a 
recent graduate of Georgia Tech, with a B.S. in computer 
science and a minor in philosophy. I graduated with highest honors.

Despite my androgynous-sounding name (and my terrifyingly
macho last name), I\'m a lady! 
We\'re few and far-between in the software development 
world (although efforts like [Rails Girls](http://www.railsgirls.com/atl) 
are hopefully increasing our numbers). 

Complicating matters is my membership in 
[Georgia Tech\'s co-ed chapter](http://psiugt.org) of 
a historically male fraternity, [Psi Upsilon](http://www.psiu.org). 
Although it\'s an understandable mistake (Georgia Tech? 
Computer science? *Fraternity???*), I cannot begin to 
count the number of times I\'ve been addressed 
via email as \"Mr. Killpack\".

*Malgré vers six années d\'études,* I speak some seriously mediocre French. 

I like to eat good food, drink good beer, and watch good 
(and bad) movies. I have a good memory for random pieces of
pop culture ephemera and assorted weirdness. I was once voted 
\"Most Likely to Tell You About a TV Show\". (Seriously!)

I like to make [dumb things](http://www.killpack.biz). 
If you have an aversion to Comic Sans or explosion GIFs, 
you probably shouldn\'t click that link. (Don\'t judge me! 
I started playing with computers during Geocities\' heyday,
which means that I have a love for 
[all that stuff](http://divshot.github.io/geo-bootstrap/)
located deep in my bones. I make no apologies.)

(I also apparently put a lot of parentheticals in my writing.)
